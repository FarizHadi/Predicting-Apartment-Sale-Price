## About

Daegu Apartment Sale Price Prediction is a capstone-project-3 that i use to hone my machine learning skill while enrolled as Purwadhika's student (Data Science Stream). This project is about predicting the optimal sell price (sqft) of an apartment unit given the data. This project hone my skill in seeing the important of each step of machine learning, primarly in how to making sure the connectivity of quality of data with the model that we built and how we can interpret the prediction coming out from model we built using SHAP. This project assist me to level up my understanding of machine learning and preparring me to future collaborations. Several valuable concept i gained such as : SHAP, Feature Importance, Ensemble Model vs standalone Model and how ensemble model works internally like boosting and bagging.
